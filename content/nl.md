proceduretext: "The Netherlands have neen the first country to fully implement the copyright directive in December 2020. The mInistry of justice held an online consultation in June 2019 and the Parliamentary process allowed civil society groups voice concerns that resulted in marginal improvements of the proposed law."

art17text: "The Dutch implementation of Article 17 is a literal transposition of Article 17 that does not contain any ex-ante user rights safguards or additional transparency provisions and does not narrow down the definition of platforms affected by these rules. The Minister of justice has the ability to provide further rules for the application of the provision, but there is no indication as to how these would look like yet."

othertext: "The Dutch implementation does not allow the Education exception to be overridden by contract, it does not include a transposition of Article 14 (Existing dutch law does not protect unoriginal reproductions). The scope of the press publisher right is relatively limited."
